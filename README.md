# Garage Management System

## Overview
The Garage Management System is a C# application developed on the .NET framework to manage garage operations. It includes vehicle management, customer interactions, and service tracking.

## Features
- Vehicle intake, removal, and updates
- Customer data management
- Service and repair tracking
- Report generation

## OOP Concepts
This system leverages key Object-Oriented Programming principles:

- **Inheritance**: Different vehicle types (Car, Motorcycle, Truck) inherit from a base `Vehicle` class.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows different vehicle types to be handled uniformly.
- **Encapsulation**: Protects internal state of objects, ensuring controlled access.
- **Abstraction**: Defines common interfaces for vehicle types and services.
